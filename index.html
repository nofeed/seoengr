    <p class="mx-6">I was very bored on my vacation in Spain, so I started reading a book on SEO. As usual, I thought
      the subject was <strong>interesting and inspiring</strong>, something I should know more about.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">I've read a few books and several articles about it in the years, always being interested in search
      engines (or, to put it mildly, "do cool things with huge amounts of data"), but as Confucio once said,
      <cite>"knowledge without practice is useless"</cite>, as a software developer working primarily on 
      the web I never really took action and always felt something was lacking.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">Here we go then, my journey into SEO starts here, writing about my discoveries, experiments, and 
      mistakes, hopefully with the help of a few friends.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">My name is 
      <a href="https://nofeed.org" alt="Nicholas Wieland's personal website" class="underline">
        Nicholas Wieland, I'm a software engineer working mainly in Ruby (but not only)
      </a>, 
      and I'd like to play with search engines.</p>
