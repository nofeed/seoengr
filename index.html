    <p class="mx-6">I was very bored on my vacation in Spain, so I started reading a book on SEO. As usual, I thought the subject
      was <strong>interesting and inspiring</strong>, something I should know more about.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">Over the years, I've read books and articles on search engines and found them intriguing. However, as a web developer, 
      I never put my knowledge into practice and felt unsatisfied. As Confucius once said, <q>knowledge without practice is useless</q>.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">I'm embarking on a <strong>technical SEO</strong> journey, sharing my experiments, discoveries, and mishaps, 
      hopefully with the aid of some friends. Let's begin!.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">My name is 
      <a href="https://nofeed.org" title="Nicholas Wieland's personal website" class="underline">
        Nicholas Wieland, I'm a software engineer working mainly in Ruby (but not only)
      </a>.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">Am I an expert? As an engineer, yes. As an SEO specialist, absolutely not. This blog tells my adventures learning,
      hopefully producing interesting and useful content in the meantime.</p>
    <p class="mx-6">If you want to say hello, talk to me, propose a post you'd like to write, <a href="mailto:hello@seoengr.net">e-mail me</a>,
      you will surely get an answer as soon as possible.</p>
